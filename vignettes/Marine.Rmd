## Data Source

[MARINe (Multi-Agency Rocky Intertidal Network)](https://marine.ucsc.edu/index.html) data 
is not publicly available (though it is available upon request). As a consequence, interactive
figures containing MARINe data can only be generated by users that have been given data access.
The MARINe-related **onmsR** functions assume that the MARINe data is available locally, with local 
access provided via the application [Google Drive File Stream](https://support.google.com/drive/answer/7329379). Google Drive File Stream in turn connects to a 
non-public Google Drive that contains the MARINe data.
